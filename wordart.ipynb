    "# WordArt\n",
    "\n",
    "Written by John Wallin\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a short code that changes text into art.  The basic idea is to use\n",
    "an image as a mask for text, so the image is showing through the text. \n",
    "It allows you to experiment with graphical representations of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text used in this project is downloaded from Project Gutenberg, \n",
    "but you could use other sources as well.  The art templates used\n",
    "could come form anywhere, but for most of the simple examples I have\n",
    "played with creating a black and white stencil in your favorite\n",
    "painting and drawing program works well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the graphics, simple is better. Blocks of black and white areas\n",
    "are the best option.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a pretty easy code to write. The main time sink for me\n",
    "was looking up how some of the library functions worked.  The logic \n",
    "behind the code is very straightforward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the output of the code, I decided write the images as Powerpoint\n",
    "slides. This seems a bit strange, but Powerpoint is a relatively universal\n",
    "format that most people can use. The target of this project\n",
    "is to create large poster-sized art projects.  Since my home\n",
    "printer can't make 20x16 prints, I will need to bring the output\n",
    "to some place like Staples or Fex Ex printing.  Powerpoint files\n",
    "work very well at these kinds of commerical sites.  Of course,\n",
    "any OpenOffice software should be able to read these files as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Three main libraries are used for the project:\n",
    "- The python-pptx library to create Powerpoint slides in python.\n",
    "- The python image library (PIL) to read and manipulate the images.\n",
    "- The requests library to download data from Gutenburg.\n",
    "- The regular expression library (re) to help clean up weird unicode characters in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Share and enjoy!\n",
